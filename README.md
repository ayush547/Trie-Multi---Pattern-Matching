# Trie-Multi-Pattern-Matching
Trie generation is carried for using multiple patterns given which need to be searched for in the text.
The code makes use of the fact that strings are only composed of 'A,G,T,C' characters and hence utitilises an integer array of size 4 for mapping the edges, in a more generalised case a map<char,int> would have to used.
